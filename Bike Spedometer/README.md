# Bike Speedometer 

A project made for a Digital Electronics course. This is a 74xx series digital bike speedometer! This was a really fun project to make, I love working with these old 74xx series chips! No code here but had to include. A video demo is [HERE](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QLju8VCnBsMLTWzm1).
