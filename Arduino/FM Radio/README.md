# FM Radio

A project for a Microprocessors course in college. This is a simple FM radio using a TEA5767 radio receiver, LCD, and keypad. This was done last minuet in one night after spending two days trying to get another idea to work and finally deciding it wouldn't in time. Not bad for one night though! Also have a report written up on it.
