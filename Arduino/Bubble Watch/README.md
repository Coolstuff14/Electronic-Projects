# Bubble Watch

This was an idea I had to make a watch from an old 60s HP bubble display. I built a prototype on a bread board. Then made a schematic in EAGLE and started working on the PCB layout. The watch is going to use SMD parts and a rechargeable lithium ion battery. Unfortunately my dumb ass lost the schematic file during a recent computer switch over! So progress is halted for now.
